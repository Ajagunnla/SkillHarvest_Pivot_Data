     - **Units Sold by Day Category**
     - **Top 10 Markets by Revenue**

     - Revenue by Region  
     - Units Sold by Region  
     - Top 10 Markets by Revenue  
     - Revenue by Day of the Week

     - Revenue by Fiscal Period
   
   - **Pie Charts**:  
     - Revenue Distribution by Line of Business  
     - Revenue by Day Category
   

### 4. **Key Insights**
   - **Regional Performance**: Certain regions consistently outperformed others in terms of total revenue and units sold.

   - **Sales Patterns**: Notable trends in sales were identified based on the day of the week, fiscal periods, and day categories (WorkDay vs. Holiday).
   - **Store-Level Analysis**: Scatter plots helped identify which stores are performing best in terms of revenue and units sold.

### 5. **Final Summary**
   The pivot tables and charts provided deep insights into the company's sales performance, highlighting key areas of growth and opportunities for optimization. The analysis can be used to refine business strategies and improve profitability.
